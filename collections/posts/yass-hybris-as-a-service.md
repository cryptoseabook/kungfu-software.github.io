SAP Hybris recently released YaaS Open Beta. Now every individuals or organizations **[can register for free](https://www.yaas.io)** at the moment. (At least the time I am writing this post 09/10/2015) <br><br>

## Overview and background
YaaS stands for Hybris as a Service. So it's really a big cloud offering from hybris in ecommerce space. If you are in the SAP Space and you will know, SAP is losing ground on Cloud Offering. I guess no one on earth is gonna use those heavy ERP, CRM on premise system, which cost millions even billions to build and maintain. <br>

SAP is actively transfering into Cloud solutions and trying to get the edge of the future. Look, they have [Cloud for Customer](http://go.sap.com/product/crm/cloud-customer-engagement.html) (A cloud offering for on-premise CRM system), which is not as popular as [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com). They bought [Success Factors SAP Jam](http://www.successfactors.com/en_us/solutions/social-collaboration/jam.html) to compete [Microsoft Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/), which is far behind Microsoft. And they are pushing [SAP UI5](https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/) and [SAP Fiori](https://experience.sap.com/fiori/) as their on-go UI Strategy. (I would still prefer using Angular-JS and Bootstrap). <br>

None of the above offering, SAP can boast to say the market leader, but they wish YaaS can be. As far as my research goes, in ecommerce PaaS space, there is no really giant can compete with Hybris YaaS. There is one company called [Moltin](https://moltin.com/), which I was actively in their Slack chat room and played around their products. I think it's an amazing product with very few resources, (3-4 active devs including their CEO as far as i know), and it's a typical venture-backed Start-Up. Also I heard there is another company called [sphere.io](http://sphere.io) in this space. However Hybris has hundreds devs and almost infinite resources within SAP's blued-eye boy. It's just a matter of time, Hybris YaaS will get the edge over those start-ups.

## What's YaaS offering? <br>

### It's like any PaaS, you can use their provided API Services to consume and post content.
  - Core services for developing your own Service Pacakge.
  - Email Services
  - Algolia Commerce Search for searching products
  - Commerce as a service pacakge as a core package for ecommerce APIs including Checkout, Shipping, Customer Profiles, Shopping Cart etc.

### You can also publish your own service package to their market place
  - Follow their rules and you can create a service pacakge and upload to their market space and make money
  - So far there is none third-party Service Pacakge in the market place
  - There is no details regarding how to make money out of your own service, but it's most likely based on subscription model

### Provide some reports, insights and data analyzing
  - It's a coming soon feature



## Initial thought after 4 hours hack
  - It's a smart idea for both providing service to consume and service to deploy
  - It's a bit confusing using their YaaS Builder. Lots of stuff in there.
  - Dont know what's the YaaS targeting market. Is it for small-mid businesses? But it's SAP right?
  - Still in its infancy stage, may change dramatically in the next 6 - 12 months.

## What's next?
  I am tossing the idea to build an Angular JS app on top of YaaS, or maybe an open UI5 App. And maybe build a service to deploy on the YaaS market to make some money? I can't wait to explore more. What about you?
