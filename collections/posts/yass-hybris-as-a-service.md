SAP Hybris recently released YaaS Open Beta. Now every individual or organisation **[can register for free](https://www.yaas.io)** at the moment. (At least the time I am writing this post 09/10/2015) <br><br>

## Overview and background
YaaS stands for Hybris as a Service. So it's really a big cloud offering from hybris in the e-commerce space. If you are in the SAP space, you will know SAP is losing ground on Cloud Offering. I guess no one on earth is going to use those heavy ERP and CRM on premise systems, which cost millions even billions to build and maintain. <br>

SAP is actively transferring into Cloud solutions and trying to get the edge over other competitors. Look, they have [Cloud for Customer](http://go.sap.com/product/crm/cloud-customer-engagement.html) (a cloud offering for CRM system), which is not as popular as [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com). To compete with [Microsoft Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/), They bought [Success Factors SAP Jam](http://www.successfactors.com/en_us/solutions/social-collaboration/jam.html), which is far behind Microsoft offering. And they are pushing [SAP UI5](https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/) and [SAP Fiori](https://experience.sap.com/fiori/) as their on-go UI Strategy. (I would still prefer using Angular-JS and Bootstrap). <br>

None of the above offering, SAP can boast to say the market leader, but they wish YaaS can be. As far as my research goes, in e-commerce PaaS space, there is no real giant that can compete with Hybris YaaS. There is one company called [Moltin](https://moltin.com/). I was actively in their Slack chat room and played around their products. I think it's an amazing product with very few resources, (3-4 active developers including their CEO as far as i know), and it's a typical venture-backed Start-Up. Also I heard there is another company called [Sphere.io](http://sphere.io) in this space. However Hybris has hundreds developers and with almost infinite resources is now SAP's blue-eyed boy. It's just a matter of time, Hybris YaaS will get the edge over those start-ups.

## What's YaaS offering? <br>

### It's like any PaaS, you can use their provided API Services to consume and post content.
  - Core services for developing your own Service Package.
  - Email Services
  - Algolia Commerce Search for searching products
  - Commerce as a service package as a core package for ecommerce APIs including Checkout, Shipping, Customer Profiles, Shopping Cart etc.

### You can also publish your own service package to their market place
  - Follow their rules and you can create a service package and upload to their market space and make money
  - So far there is none third-party Service package in the market place
  - There are no details regarding how to make money out of your own service, but it's most likely based on subscription model

### Provide some reports, insights and data analyzing
  - It's a coming soon feature



## Initial thought after 4 hours hack
  - It's a smart idea for both providing service-to-consume and service-to-deploy
  - It's a bit confusing using their YaaS Builder. Lots of stuff in there.
  - Dont know what's the YaaS targeting market. Is it for small-mid businesses? But it's SAP right?
  - Still in its infancy stage, may change dramatically in the next 6 - 12 months.

## What's next?
  I am tossing the idea between building an AngularJS or an open UI5 App on top of YaaS. And maybe build a service to deploy on the YaaS market to make some money? I can't wait to explore more. What about you?
